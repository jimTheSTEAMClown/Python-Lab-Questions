Challenge #1
Run, then make sure you understand why is "s" bigger 
than "S" and why a blank space is printed:
      
Using the built-in Functions max() & min()
- Why is "s" bigger than "S"?
- Why does it look like the "smallest" did not print anything?
- Is it what you expected? Can you explain it?

Challenge #2
Update the code above to use the input() function and 
ask the user for a long sentence string and assign 
it to the variable 'my_string'

With this new user input string, see what the min() and 
max() character is.
