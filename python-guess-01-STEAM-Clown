# Using an IF/ELSE write a program to have a hard coded variable <user_guess> 
# compared to a hard coded variable <number_2_guess> and print the results.
# You will use this source code in the next few program labs

# (instructions) Add your code here
#  1) Add some comments to describe your code
#     guess-01-YourFirstName-YourLastName.py

# (instructions) Add your code here
#  2) Add some print() statements to describe to
#     the user what is happening and expected.


# (instructions) Add your code here
#  3) Add a variable: number_2_guess = 7
#  4) print() the variable number_2_guess


# (instructions) Add your code here
# 5) Add a hard coded user guess
# user_guess = 5 


# (instructions) Add your code here
#  6) print the type() of the user_guess to show it is an integer
#  7) print() the value of the user_guess variable


# (instructions) Add your code here
#  8) Add an IF statement to check if user_guess is equal to number_2_guess
#  9) If they are equal, print() something like 'Good Guess, you are a Winner'
# 10) also print() <user_guess> is equal to <number_2_guess>

  
# (instructions) Add your code here
# 11) Add an ELSE statement and in that block print() if they are not equal
# 12) print() something like 'Better Luck Next Time'
# 13) also print() <user_guess> is NOT equal to <number_2_guess>


# (instructions) Add your code here
# 14) End with a print() that says something like 'All Done!'
