# Program challenge: Is a number from the user between 
# 2 random numbers? 
# 
# This challenge while contrived, will let you exercise 
# a WHILE loop and make decisions using a IF/ELIF/ELSE.
# It will also incorporate the RANDOM function
#
# The goal of this program is to generate 2 random 
# numbers from 0 - 20 and ask the user for a number, 
# and see if the input user number is between the 
# 2 random numbers.
#
# Break the solution down:
# 1) Create 2 random numbers and store them in variables
# 2) Check to see which random number is smaller, and 
#    swap them if needed
# 3) Ask the user for a number (Hint: be sure to validate 
#    that the input is a number, and you don't get 
#    traceback errors for any input)
# 4) Check to see if the user number is between the 2 
#    random numbers
# 5) print() the 3 numbers and report if the user 
#    number is smaller, larger or between the 2 
#    random numbers
